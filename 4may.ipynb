Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur. With modern analytics platforms, these visualizations can go far beyond line graphs."

    "#6CF and PACF plots: After a time series has been stationarized by differencing, the next step in fitting an ARIMA model is to determine whether AR or MA terms are needed to correct any autocorrelation that remains in the differenced series. Of course, with software like Statgraphics, you could just try some different combinations of terms and see what works best. But there is a more systematic way to do this. By looking at the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots of the differenced series, you can tentatively identify the numbers of AR and/or MA terms that are needed. You are already familiar with the ACF plot: it is merely a bar chart of the coefficients of correlation between a time series and lags of itself. The PACF plot is a plot of the partial correlation coefficients between the series and lags of itself."
